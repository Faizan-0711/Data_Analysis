# Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis

## Project Objective :
To Analyze the given data and Forecast the Maket Size of the Electric Vehicles in the United States.

## Dataset :
Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.zip

## Details of the Dataset :
The provided dataset contains the following columns, each representing different aspects of the electric vehicle (EV) population in the United States:

1. VIN (1-10): Partial Vehicle Identification Number.
2. County: The county in which the vehicle is registered.
3. City: The city in which the vehicle is registered.
4. State: The state in which the vehicle is registered. It appears that this dataset may be focused on Washington (WA) state.
5. Postal Code: The postal code where the vehicle is registered.
6. Model Year: The year of the vehicle model.
7. Make: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
8. Model: The model of the vehicle.
9. Electric Vehicle Type: The type of electric vehicle, e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV).
10. Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility: Eligibility status for clean alternative fuel vehicle programs.
11. Electric Range: The maximum range of the vehicle on a single charge (in miles).
12. Base MSRP: The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price.
13. Legislative District: The legislative district where the vehicle is registered.
14. DOL Vehicle ID: Department of Licensing Vehicle Identification.
15. Vehicle Location: Geographic coordinates of the vehicle location.
16. Electric Utility: The electric utility service provider for the vehicle’s location.
17. 2020 Census Tract: The census tract for the vehicle’s location.

## Steps :
Data Cleaning --> Basic Statistical Analysis --> Data Visualisation --> Generating Insights --> Forecasting the Market Size --> Visualizing the Market Size --> Conclucion.

## Insights :
1. Upward trend is observed in vehicles registration, modest increase is seen from 2017. However in 2023 a sharp increase can be seen in EV vehicle registration.
2. Top 3 counties in terms of EV registration were King, Snohomish and Pierce. The above bar graph shows that the most number of Ev registration took place in the King County. The city 'Seattle' from the king county show the most number of registration which is considerably higher than the city 'Bellevue' and 'Redmond' of King County as well. 'Bothell' in Snohomish and 'Tacoma' in Pierce shows the highest EV registration in that county respectively.
3. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) are more popular or preferred over Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles(PHEV) among the EV registration in US.
4. TESLA being the most popular EV Make leading by a substantial margin with the highest number of EV Registered. NISSAN is the second most popular manufacturer followed by CHEVROLET, both having significantly fewer registration than TESLA.
5. TESLA models have the highest ranges, ROADSTER of TESLA having the highest electric range. BOLT of CHEVROLET performes the best for the CHEVROLET in terms of Electric Range. NISSAN’s LEAF and CHEVROLET’s SPARK are in the lower half of the chart, suggesting more modest average ranges.

## Conclusion : 
EV market size is expected to expand considerably. The increase in the EV registrations in the forecasted data suggests that the consumer adoptation of EVs is on the rise, and this trend is likely to continue.
Overall, A promising Future for the EV industry, indicating a shift in consumer preferences to EV Vehicles and a potential increase in the related investment and buisness opportunities.

## Goals Achieved from this Project :
1. Assessd the historical growth trend of EV registrations.
2. Forecasted future EV registrations based on historical trends.
3. Analyzed the distribution of EV registrations across different models, makes, and geographical regions.
4. Estimated the market size and growth potential of the EV market for upcoming years.
5. Provided insights to support stakeholders in decision-making processes related to production, infrastructure planning, and policy formulation.
